## Before 0.1.0:

- Clientside Routes
  - high-level supervisors list
  - high level processes list
  - supervisor detail
  - process detail

- Tail stdout/stderr via websockets
  - should go in process detail page
  - use chord library?

- Process control
  - start-all
  - stop-all
  - restart-all

- Better test coverage!
  - Schemas for api endpoints

## Planned features

- Filterable views (supervisors/processes)
